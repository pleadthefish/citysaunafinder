I need to rebuild citysaunafinder.com from scratch with superior design and authentic voice. This is Phase 1: Product Foundation - getting to feature parity with saunafinder.com but with better UX/UI.

CRITICAL: Before you write ANY code, read these skill files:
- /mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md (we may need documentation)
- Any other relevant skills for web development

!these skill files are in development. Future action will critically rely on them. We are just getting a jumpstart right now!

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Current site: citysaunafinder.com (basic HTML, hosted on Cloudflare)
- Competitor benchmark: saunafinder.com (we're copying their data breadth, NOT their design)
- Goal: Minimal friction, bucolic design, mobile-first
- Data strategy: Import ALL saunafinder.com venue data now, refine later
- This is Phase 1 of 3 (Foundation → Traffic → Monetization)

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Scandinavian minimalism meets editorial design
- Think: Kinfolk magazine, Monocle, Finnish sauna heritage
- Color palette: Cedar wood tones (#D4A574), Steam white (#F5F5F5), Hot stone gray (#3A3A3A)
- Typography: Editorial hierarchy, NOT SaaS startup
- NO: Rounded corners everywhere, gradient buttons, corporate purple/blue
- YES: Generous whitespace, real photography, natural materials aesthetic

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Modern React with TypeScript
2. Mobile-first responsive (75% of searches are mobile)
3. Fast load times (already using Cloudflare)
4. Clean component architecture
5. Simple routing (React Router or Next.js - you decide what's best)

CORE FEATURES (MVP):
1. Homepage
   - Hero section with clear value prop
   - Search bar (city/zip input + sauna type filter)
   - Featured venues (3-6 cards)
   - Simple, beautiful design

2. Search/Browse
   - Filter by: City, Sauna type (Traditional/Finnish/Infrared/Russian Banya/Korean/Steam), Price range
   - Results as clean cards with: Name, Type, Photo, Address, Brief description
   - Mobile-optimized list view

3. Venue Detail Pages
   - All the info: Name, Address, Phone, Website, Hours, Sauna types, Amenities, Pricing
   - Photo gallery placeholder
   - Map integration (Google Maps embed)
   - CTA: "Visit Website" or "Call Now"

4. City Pages
   - "[City] Saunas" landing pages
   - Intro text (placeholder for now, we'll write authentic content later)
   - List of venues in that city
   - SEO-optimized structure

5. Simple Navigation
   - Logo/Home
   - Browse Cities
   - About (placeholder)
   - List Your Sauna (placeholder CTA)

DATA ACQUISITION:
- Scrape/import saunafinder.com venue database (name, address, phone, type, city, basic details)
- Store in JSON initially (we can move to proper DB later if needed)
- Aim for 100-200 venues minimum across 10-15 major cities to start
- Data structure: 
  {
    id, name, address, city, state, zip, phone, website, 
    sauna_types: [], amenities: [], 
    price_range, description, 
    coordinates: {lat, lng}
  }

WHAT I'M PROVIDING:
[I will add directory setup and any existing files to migrate]

YOUR DELIVERABLES:
1. Clean project structure
2. Scraped/formatted venue data (at least 100 venues)
3. Working search functionality
4. Responsive, beautiful design
5. Fast, production-ready code

CONSTRAINTS:
- Focus on design quality and user experience
- Keep it simple - no over-engineering
- Make it LOOK professional and authentic
- Data enrichment comes later, just get the base data in

Begin by:
NOTE: assess what the state of the project as is, and critically analyze if this prompt doesn't properly speak to it as it attempts to build something better. 
1. Proposing the tech stack and project structure
2. Creating a plan for data acquisition from saunafinder.com
3. Showing me mockups/wireframes of the key pages before coding
4. Building iteratively so I can review design decisions

Remember: This needs to look and feel BETTER than saunafinder.com while having similar data coverage. The design is our competitive advantage.
```

```
DIRECTORY SETUP:
- Archive current files to /citysaunafinder-old and rebuild in root
- keep reference & docs separate from web build, those are for my reference. 
- preserve necessary files that can be universally applied.
