CITYSAUNAFINDER.COM - CLAUDE CODE TRAINING GUIDE
Based on Reddit Post: "Claude Code is a Beast - Tips from 6 Months of Hardcore Use"
================================================

## WHAT YOU CAN STEAL IMMEDIATELY

### 1. CLAUDE.md File (Your Project Constitution)

Create `/citysaunafinder/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
# CitySaunaFinder - Project Guidelines

## Brand Voice
- Write like you actually use saunas
- NO: "nestled", "boasts", "perfect", "ultimate", "curated"
- YES: Specific details, opinions, irreverence, authenticity
- Example tone: "The löyly here is weak and the regulars know it"

## Design Principles
- Scandinavian minimalism meets editorial design
- Color palette: Cedar (#D4A574), Steam (#F5F5F5), Stone (#3A3A3A)
- Typography: Inter for UI, Crimson Text for editorial
- NO rounded corners everywhere, NO gradient buttons

## Content Standards
Every venue listing MUST include:
- Sauna type (traditional/infrared/Russian banya/etc.)
- Temperature range
- Clothing policy
- One sensory detail (smell of cedar, sound of aufguss, etc.)
- One opinion or cultural context

## File Structure
/data - Venue data (JSON)
/content - Blog posts & city pages
/components - React components
/styles - CSS modules
```

### 2. Skills System (For This Project)

Create custom instructions/project context:

**Skill: "sauna-content-writer"**

```markdown
# Sauna Content Writing Standards

## Voice Examples
BAD: "This spa offers a luxurious sauna experience"
GOOD: "The Finnish sauna runs at 185°F and the owner will judge you if you don't know how to make proper löyly"

## Required Elements
- Cultural authenticity markers
- Specific temperatures, materials, rituals
- Who actually goes there (locals vs tourists)
- What makes it weird/special/authentic

## Forbidden Phrases
[List all AI-sounding phrases to avoid]
```

**Skill: "citysauna-design"**

```markdown
# Design System

## Typography
- Headlines: Crimson Text, 600 weight
- Body: Inter, 400 weight
- Never use default system fonts

## Layout Patterns
- Card-based venue listings
- Full-bleed hero images
- Generous whitespace (2-3x what feels right)

## Reference Sites
[Include 3-5 screenshots or links to sites you want to emulate]
```

## LEARNING PATH (PRIORITIZED)

### Week 1: Foundation
1. Read the full DEV.to post (✓ Done)
2. Create basic CLAUDE.md for your project
3. Write ONE sauna description yourself as the gold standard
4. Create one "skill" with your brand voice guidelines

### Week 2: Implementation
1. Use your CLAUDE.md + skill in every prompt
2. When Claude produces AI slop, immediately correct: 
   "This is too generic. Rewrite using the voice guidelines in sauna-content-writer skill"
3. Add successful examples to your skill file
4. Start building consistency

### Week 3+: Advanced (If Needed)
- Custom hooks (probably overkill for your project size)
- Subagents for specific tasks (venue scraper, content reviewer)
- Scripts for data collection automation

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR YOUR PROJECT

From that post, these principles matter most:

1. **"Ask not what Claude can do for you, ask what context you can give to Claude"**
   - Your CLAUDE.md is the single most important file

2. **Planning is King**
   - Always plan before building
   - Create written plans you can review

3. **Iterative Refinement**
   - First output will be mediocre
   - Show Claude YOUR rewrite
   - "Match THIS tone exactly"

4. **Documentation as Training**
   - Every good example you create teaches Claude
   - Save successful outputs as reference

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

Before your next Claude Code session:

1. Create CLAUDE.md with brand voice + design guidelines
2. Write 3 example sauna descriptions yourself
3. Add them to the CLAUDE.md as "gold standard examples"
4. Start every prompt with: "Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines exactly"

**The difference**: 
Going from "make me a sauna website" 
to "make me a sauna website following the voice, design, and content standards in CLAUDE.md" 
is night and day.

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM REDDIT POST

### Skills Auto-Activation System
- The author created TypeScript hooks that automatically load relevant skills
- Skills contain best practices (500 lines max)
- Hooks check for keywords/file patterns and inject skill references before Claude sees your prompt
- Result: Consistent output without manually reminding Claude every time

### Dev Docs System (Task Management)
For every large task, create three files:
1. `[task-name]-plan.md` - The accepted plan
2. `[task-name]-context.md` - Key files, decisions
3. `[task-name]-tasks.md` - Checklist of work

This prevents Claude from "losing the plot" during long sessions.

### Planning Process
- ALWAYS use planning mode first
- Review the plan thoroughly before accepting
- Catch mistakes/misunderstandings early
- Create dev docs immediately after planning

### Hooks System Benefits
- Auto-format code with Prettier after edits
- Run build checks after Claude responds
- Catch TypeScript errors immediately
- Gentle reminders for error handling

### Quality Tips
- Have Claude review its own code
- Use specialized subagents for specific tasks
- Create slash commands for repeated workflows
- Document everything as you go

### Prompt Engineering
- Be as specific as possible
- Don't lead with your opinions if you want honest feedback
- If unsure, ask Claude to research and present options
- Include context about what you DON'T want

## PROMPT IMPROVEMENT FORMULA

### Bad Prompt:
"Write about saunas in Austin"

### Good Prompt:
"Write like Anthony Bourdain covering saunas. Conversational, opinionated, 
irreverent but knowledgeable. No marketing speak. No "nestled in" or 
"boasts" or "perfect for." Short sentences. Specific details over generalities.

Talk about: weird regulars, the exact smell of cedar, whether the löyly 
is authentic or sad, if tourists ruin it. 

Example tone: "The Russian lady who runs this place will judge your 
towel etiquette and you'll deserve it."

Now write about [specific sauna]."
